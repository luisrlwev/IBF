                            The curriculum was unwavering and has enhanced my business tremendously.<br>

                            I think what a lot of individuals fear when going into an executive educational program, is, "Will the information gleaned from the program be applied to my practice?" That has not been the case with IBF.<br>

                            I truly do not understand why many other professionals do not seek to complete the entire MSFS program. It's well rounded and designed to nurture the financial professional into becoming a more mature and respected individual from both their clients and their peers."</p>
